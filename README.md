# jambore_education(Regression analysis)

Jamboree has recently launched a feature where students/learners can come to their website and check their probability of getting into the IVY league college. This feature estimates the chances of graduate admission from an Indian perspective.
my analysis will help Jamboree in understanding what factors are important in graduate admissions and how these factors are interrelated among themselves. It will also help predict one's chances of admission given the rest of the variables.


**Outcome_of_the_project**

1)data contains more number of students having research experience, this is positive thing for jamboree education because the students with experience in research have high chances of admission .

2)for admission in rank_1 college research_exp also contribute towards chance of getting admission in tier_1 college.this can be new bussiness apportunity to jamboree education where they can  also list research_opportunity for undergrads which increse their chance of admission in tier  college

3)chance of admission in goes above 60% if GRE_score is above 315 for tier_1 university and for tier_2_university score 300.

4)TOEFL_scores have high correlation with GRE_scores this emplies someone  who scored good in  TOEFL have high probanility in scoring high in GRE. jamboree can use same educational containt for both the exams and hence no need create different on cource for each exam.

5)by applying multiple linear regression model our model able to predict chance_of_admission with accuracy of about 82%. 

6)candidates having higher cgpa have high chance of getting admissions hence jamboore can also focus on creating graduation course study content which will help students to have high cgpa which will increse theire chances of admission and also after graduation we will have data of students who have high CGPA these will be our first priority custumers.
